# Super Mario 64 Android Port
This is a port of the reconstructed Super Mario 64 source code to Android using SDL2 with OpenGL ES 2.0.

It has cross-platform Touch Controls, Audio works, it saves the game to the app's internal storage and you can play it with an external keyboard or controller as well (tested on PS3 controller).

# Branches:
* `master`: Vanilla SM64 port, barely any modifications.
* `sm64ex`: Master branch of sm64ex.
* `sm64ex_nightly`: Nightly branch of sm64ex. Use this one for Render96/SGI models!

# Build instructions

## Android
Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android/tree/master)!

(please note that building on Android is currently incomplete)

## Linux

**Install dependencies:**

This depends on your distro, but if you can build the PC port and you have Android SDK/NDK and you are able to build Android apps using gradle, you should be fine.

**Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base
cd sm64-port-android-base
```

**Copy in your baserom:**
```sh
cp /path/to/your/baserom.z64 ./app/jni/src/baserom.us.z64
```

**Get SDL sources:**
```sh
./getSDL.sh
```

**Perform native build:**
```sh
# if you have more cores available, you can increase the --jobs parameter
cd app/jni/src
make --jobs 4
cd ../../..
```

**Perform Android build:**
```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Enjoy your apk:**
```sh
ls -al ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Windows

**Install dependencies:**

You'll need everything you need to make Windows builds, and to be able to build Android apps using `gradlew.bat`. This includes Java JDK (with the JDK being JAVA_HOME) and Android SDK/NDK. Every commmand is executed in MSYS2 unless otherwise noted.

You'll also need `unzip` in MSYS2 MinGW. Do do this, open MSYS2 MinGW, and
```sh
pacman -S unzip
```

**Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base
```

**Copy in your baserom:**
Use the file explorer, or whatever you want, just put it in `app/jni/src`, and name it like you'd do on the PC port.
```sh
cp /path/to/your/baserom.z64 ./app/jni/src/baserom.us.z64
```

**Get SDL sources:**
```sh
./getSDL.sh
```

**Perform native build:**
```sh
# if you have more cores available, you can increase the --jobs parameter
cd app/jni/src
make --jobs 4
cd ../../..
```

**Perform Android build:**
Do this in a normal Command Prompt!
```
gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

## Docker

**Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base
```

**Create the build image:**
```sh
# navigate into newly cloned repo
cd sm64-port-android-base
# build the docker image
docker build . -t sm64_android
```
**Copy in your baserom:**
```sh
cp /path/to/your/baserom.z64 ./app/jni/src/baserom.us.z64
```

**Setup symlinks for SDL:**
```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 sm64_android sh -c "ln -nsf /SDL2-2.0.12/src /sm64/app/jni/SDL/src"
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 sm64_android sh -c "ln -nsf /SDL2-2.0.12/include /sm64/app/jni/SDL/include"
```

**Perform native build:**
```sh
# if you have more cores available, you can increase the --jobs parameter
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 sm64_android sh -c "cd /sm64/app/jni/src && make --jobs 4"
```

**Perform Android build:**
```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 sm64_android sh -c "./gradlew assembleDebug"
```

**Enjoy your apk:**
```sh
ls -al ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

# Configuration
If you want to customize the build with build options, you should make the native build with those options first (put them after the make command like on normal repos), then before performing the Android build, edit `app/jni/src/Android.mk` and enable the options you'd like.


# Compile on Android
Follow these steps to configure the build environment in Android and compile the from scratch:

**Install Termux from Google Play Store:**

**Install the required dependencies inside the Termux environment:**
```sh
pkg install git wget make python getconf zip apksigner clang
```
**Clone the appropriate repository using git:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android
```
**Change directory to the newly cloned directory:**
```sh
cd sm64-port-android
```
**Copy the baserom of the game using Termux. We don't support or condone pirating, you must supply your own copy!**
**Termux-setup-storage**
```sh
cp /sdcard/path/to/your/baserom.z64 ./baserom.us.z64
```
**Get SDL includes:**
```sh
./getSDL.sh
```
**Start the build:**
```sh
make --jobs 4
```
**Note: You can increase the value of the “jobs” parameter depending on how many CPU cores you can devote to the building process.**
**If things go well, the resulting Super Mario 64 APK should be found inside the “build” folder:**
```sh
ls -al build/us_pc/sm64.us.f3dex2e.apk
```
**That's it! You should have the APK after compilation which can be easily sideloaded on an Android device.**
